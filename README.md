## Development

### Adding New Roadmaps

1. Create a new JSON file in the `roadmap_data` directory
2. Add the roadmap metadata to `roadmap_data/roadmaps.json`
3. Import the roadmap using the admin interface

## Deployment on Render

EdgeRoute can be easily deployed on [Render](https://render.com/) using the included configuration files.

### Prerequisites

1. Create a [Render](https://render.com/) account
2. Create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account and project (for database and authentication)

### Deployment Steps

1. Fork or clone this repository to your GitHub account
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
3. Create a new Web Service in Render and select your repository
4. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` configuration
5. Set up the required environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string (from Supabase)
   - `SECRET_KEY`: A secure random string
   - `FLASK_APP`: Set to `app`
   - `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `production`
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `SUPABASE_KEY`: Your Supabase anon key
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`: Your Supabase service key
6. Deploy the application

### Updating Your Deployment

Render automatically deploys new changes when you push to your repository's main branch.
